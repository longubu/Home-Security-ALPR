# Smart Home Security & Automatic License Detection
Automatically detect and read license plates using open-sourced AI tools and Reolink's home-security cameras. The goal is to leverage existing pre-trained ML algorithms for practical smart-home surveillance without the need to train or develop fine-tuned models/algorithms, to track and store detected events, and to build custom alarm systems for smart-surveillance.
